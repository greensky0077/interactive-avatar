## Deploying the frontend to Firebase Hosting

1. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g firebase-tools
   ```
2. Login and set project:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase use YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   ```
3. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd react-avatar-app
   npm ci
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```
4. Deploy:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

Notes:
- Update `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json` to your project/site IDs.
- Configure `VITE_SERVER_URL` in your Firebase Hosting environment if your API runs elsewhere. Locally you can set it in `react-avatar-app/.env`.
- The server (Express) is not deployed by Firebase Hosting; host it separately (e.g., Render, Railway, Fly, or Firebase Functions). Set `VITE_SERVER_URL` to that server URL.
